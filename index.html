      <p>
        Migraines are a devastating neurological condition affecting over 1 billion people globally. They can cause pain, nausea, vomiting and sensory sensitivity which reduce the quality of life. Unfortunately, their unpredictable nature makes timely prevention difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to create a predictive analytics system that helps users anticipate potential migraine episodes before they occur. By analyzing key data patternsâ€”such as sleep, stress levels, weather changes and moreâ€”we aim to empower users with early warnings and actionable insights to avoid triggers and reduce attack frequency.

      <h2>Step 1: Importing Libraries ðŸ§¾</h2>
      <p>
        We begin by importing all the necessary libraries. These include:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>pandas</strong> and <strong>numpy</strong> for data manipulation</li>
          <li><strong>scikit-learn</strong> for training and evaluating machine learning models</li>
          <li><strong>imbalanced-learn</strong> for handling class imbalance using oversampling</li>
          <li>Preprocessing modules like <strong>StandardScaler</strong>, <strong>PolynomialFeatures</strong>, and <strong>PCA</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 2: Loading and Preprocessing the Dataset ðŸ§ª</h2>
      <p>
        We created a function <code>load_and_preprocess_data()</code> to automate our data pipeline. Hereâ€™s what it does:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Loads the dataset and separates features from the target column, â€˜Migraine Severityâ€™</li>
        <li>Balances the dataset using <strong>Random Oversampling</strong></li>
        <li>Applies <strong>Polynomial Features</strong> to capture interactions between input variables</li>
        <li>Uses <strong>StandardScaler</strong> for normalization</li>
        <li>Applies <strong>PCA</strong> to reduce dimensions while preserving 95% of data variance</li>
        <li>Splits data into training and testing sets (80-20)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 3: Training and Optimizing the Models ðŸ¤–</h2>
      <p>
        In the <code>train_models()</code> function, we train two regression models:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Random Forest Regressor</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Gradient Boosting Regressor</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Using <strong>GridSearchCV</strong>, we fine-tune each model with cross-validation to find the best hyperparameters. Then, we combine both models using a <strong>Voting Regressor</strong> to improve predictions by averaging their outputs.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 4: Evaluating Model Performance ðŸ“Š</h2>
      <p>
        The <code>evaluate_models()</code> function calculates:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mean Absolute Error (MAE)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Mean Squared Error (MSE)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>R-squared Score (RÂ²)</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These metrics help us judge how accurate and reliable our model is when predicting migraine severity.

      <h2>Our Experience</h2>
<p>
  Developing this project provided a valuable opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to a practical, real-world problem. Throughout the process, we deepened our understanding of data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation techniques, while also enhancing our collaboration and problem-solving skills.
</p>
<p>
  One of the most rewarding aspects was learning how each stepâ€”from data preparation to model optimizationâ€”can significantly impact the overall performance. This experience not only strengthened our technical proficiency but also emphasized the importance of teamwork, adaptability, and attention to detail in building effective data-driven solutions.
